#### Why should we hire you?

I began my DevOps journey in my previous company, Opswerks, with no prior knowledge or experience. Despite the challenges, I dedicated myself to learning everything that I can. Eventually, I rose to be one of the head of the team’s properties
which was Airflow.

As the head of one of the properties, I was tasked with overseeing its operation, ensuring that the quality of work met the client’s expectations. I also spearheaded meetings with the client to address concerns and issues, and took note of any areas for improvement within our team.

Overall, I believe I would be a valuable addition to the team, not only because of my expertise and experience but also my

#### About yourself and attitude toward present social issues

I am a passionate DevOps Engineer with strict work ethics and a well-rounded skill set with good organization skills developed by a time-pressured environment; committed to collaborate in a workplace where I can maximize my growth and see new challenges.

Regarding present social issues, I am concerned about the crab mentality where individuals attempt to pull others down to prevent them from succeeding. I believe that fostering an environment of communication and collaboration is the key to overcoming this negative mindset.
